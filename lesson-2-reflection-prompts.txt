Question:What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository lets you create a .git file within a directory. This needs to be done if you want to keep a commit tracking of files within the directory.

Question: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area holds commits that are pending, while the working directory is everything that you have within a directory. The repository is an area for all of the commits that have been made. The value of a staging area is to be able to see what changes you are going to add or reset to a commit before it is actually made, giving more control over what is committed.
